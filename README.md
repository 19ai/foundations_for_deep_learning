# foundations for deep learning:
1. I emphasize mathematical/conceptual foundations because implementations of ideas(ex. Torch, Tensorflow)
   will keep evolving but the underlying backbone must be sound. Anybody with an interest in deep learning 
   can and should try to understand why things work. 
2. I include neuroscience as a useful conceptual foundation for two reasons. First, it may provide inspiration
   for future models and algorithms. Second, the success of deep learning can contribute to useful hypotheses
   and models for computational neuroscience.
